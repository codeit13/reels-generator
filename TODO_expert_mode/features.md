# Compatibility of UI Controls Across TTS Providers

Let me analyze which UI controls are compatible with each of your voice providers:

## Kokoro TTS
**Supported Controls:**
- ✅ Voice selection (the full list of voices in `kokoro_voices.json`)
- ✅ Speech Rate (via `speed` parameter)
- ❌ Voice Style (not supported natively)
- ❌ Sentence Pause (currently implemented via SSML which isn't working)

## Elevenlabs TTS
**Supported Controls:**
- ✅ Voice selection (from Elevenlabs catalog)
- ✅ Voice Style (via style parameter in `VoiceSettings`)
- ✅ Speech Rate (needs implementation)
- ✅ Stability/Similarity/Style parameters (in your code but not exposed in UI)

## TikTok TTS
**Supported Controls:**
- ✅ Voice selection (limited set: `en_us_001`, `en_us_006`, etc.)
- ❌ Voice Style (not supported)
- ❌ Speech Rate (not supported)
- ❌ Sentence Pause (not supported)

## UI Controls Compatibility Matrix

| UI Control | Kokoro | Elevenlabs | TikTok |
|------------|--------|------------|--------|
| Voice Selection | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Language Selection | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Speech Rate | ✅ | ✅* | ❌ |
| Voice Style | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Sentence Pause | ❌† | ❌ | ❌ |
| Pause Variability | ❌† | ❌ | ❌ |

\* *Available in API but not currently implemented in your code*  
† *Currently implemented through SSML but not working (being read as text)*

## Notes on Implementation Issues

1. **Speech Rate**: 
   - For Kokoro: Currently not being passed to the API. Add `speed=self.config.speech_rate` in `generate_with_kokoro`
   - For Elevenlabs: Supported in their API but not implemented in your code

2. **Voice Style**:
   - Only works with Elevenlabs
   - In your code, you collect it but don't use it for Kokoro or TikTok

3. **Sentence Pause & Variability**:
   - These are implemented but not working properly with Kokoro
   - The SSML tags are being read as text rather than interpreted

## Recommended Changes

1. **For Kokoro**:
   ```python
   # In generate_with_kokoro method
   audio_data = await kokoro_client.create_speech(
       text=text, 
       voice=self.config.voice,
       speed=self.config.speech_rate  # Add this line
   )
   ```

2. **For UI Controls**:
   - Conditionally show Voice Style only when Elevenlabs is selected
   - Disable Speech Rate slider when TikTok is selected
   - Either fix or remove the Sentence Pause and Variability controls

Would you like me to provide specific code changes for any of these recommendations?

# ReelsMaker Project Status

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

1. **Core Functionality**
   - Docker configuration with Intel GPU acceleration
   - Basic video generation pipeline
   - Voice synthesis integration (Kokoro, TikTok, ElevenLabs)
   - UI implementation with Streamlit

2. **UI Improvements**
   - Real-time JavaScript timer for tracking generation progress
   - Cancel button with proper resource cleanup
   - Video persistence between sessions
   - Improved color pickers and font controls
   - Organized controls in logical groupings

3. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Hardware acceleration via VA-API
   - CPU thread optimization
   - Voice data loaded from JSON files
   - Session state management

4. **Basic Logging**
   - CSV logging infrastructure
   - Basic video metrics CSV output
   - Simple video match logging

## üîÑ In Progress

1. **Advanced Logging**
   - Need to improve video match logging to track:
     - Refined search queries (not just raw sentences)
     - Video selection/rejection criteria
     - Keywords causing rejection

2. **Voice & Audio Enhancements**
   - Speech rate and style controls implemented but need backend integration
   - Sentence pause duration implementation
   - Text emphasis control

## üìã Pending Tasks

1. **Content Enhancement**
   - Smart video selection based on mood
   - Platform-specific export profiles
   - Transition effects between clips
   - AI-generated content implementation

2. **Workflow Improvements**
   - Tab naming refinements
   - Batch processing capability
   - Templates system for saving settings
   - Advanced job queue UI

3. **Content Filtering**
   - Expand negative keywords list
   - Implement more sophisticated content moderation
   - Add vision-based filtering (longer term)

4. **Pexels Images Integration**
   - Add API integration for still images
   - Modify video generator to handle image sequences
   - Update UI to select between videos and images

## üîç Known Issues

1. **Video Match Logging**
   - Currently only captures basic information, not detailed selection criteria
   - All sentences currently use the same video path
   - Search queries are not refined from the original sentence

2. **Cancel Button Logic**
   - May require a secondary click in some scenarios

## üöÄ Next Steps Priority

1. Refine video match logging to capture detailed selection criteria
2. Complete backend implementation for voice style/rate controls
3. Implement transition effects between video clips
4. Add platform-specific export profiles

# ReelsMaker UI Review - Ready to Build

I've reviewed the UI code thoroughly and your changes look good. The font selection and button logic have been properly implemented. Here are a few minor observations that don't block your build but could be considered for future improvements:

## Issues Fixed âœ…

1. **Font selection** now correctly uses valid fonts from subtitle_gen.py
2. **Duplicate threads control** has been removed
3. **Generate button logic** simplified to one clear action
4. **Parameter naming** is consistent with `font_name`

## Minor Future Improvements

1. **Cancel button logic** - The cancel button appears after generation starts, but its state check happens in the same render cycle. It may need a secondary click to register.

2. **Timer display** - The elapsed time display uses a basic technique that requires page refreshes. A JavaScript component would provide smoother updates.

3. **Tab naming** - Consider renaming "Text to Speech" and "Text to Speech 2" to something more descriptive like "Direct Quote" and "AI-Generated Quote".

4. **Code cleanup** - Several commented code blocks could be removed for better readability.

## Ready to Build

The application is in a good state to build. The Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml files are properly configured to support the application's requirements, and the UI changes are compatible with the backend logic.

# Negative Content Filtering is Working 4/7/2025 3:23 pm

You've successfully implemented the content filtering system into your main application:

1. ✅ **Proper Detection**: The filter correctly identifies and rejects videos with negative keywords
2. ✅ **URL Path Extraction**: Your code now properly extracts the descriptive part of the URL path
3. ✅ **Detailed Logging**: When content is rejected, you get detailed information about why
4. ✅ **Configuration Control**: The list is loaded from your JSON file, making it easy to update

## Next Steps with Your Keywords List

The only refinement needed is expanding your negative_keywords.json file with more variations of terms:

```json
{
    "negative_keywords": [
        "argument", "arguing", "argue",
        "fight", "fighting", "fought",
        "prison", "jail", "incarceration",
        "depression", "depressed", "sad",
        "darkness", "occult", "violent", "violence",
        "conflict", "suffering"
    ]
}
```

This would catch videos like:
- "two-women-arguing-4806370" (which passed your current filter)
- "people-fighting-on-street"
- "woman-looking-depressed" 

Since the filtering is working correctly in the main application, you can now focus on expanding your list of keywords to make the filtering more comprehensive.

# Content Filtering for Pexels Media

## Current Capabilities & Implementation Options

Analyzing your codebase, I can see several ways to implement negative content filtering for Pexels media:

### Option 1: Metadata-Based Filtering (Easy Implementation)

Pexels provides basic metadata with each asset that we can leverage:

```python
async def filter_negative_content(videos_or_images):
    """Filter out potentially negative content based on metadata."""
    negative_keywords = [
        "argument", "fight", "prison", "jail", "depression", 
        "darkness", "occult", "violence", "conflict", "suffering"
    ]
    
    filtered_results = []
    for item in videos_or_images:
        description = item.get("description", "").lower()
        tags = " ".join(item.get("tags", [])).lower()
        combined_text = f"{description} {tags}"
        
        if not any(keyword in combined_text for keyword in negative_keywords):
            filtered_results.append(item)
            
    return filtered_results
```

This could be integrated into your existing `search_for_stock_videos()` function in `pexel.py` and would also work for images.

### Option 2: LLM-Based Content Moderation (Moderate Complexity)

Leverage your existing OpenAI integration for more nuanced filtering:

```python
async def moderate_with_llm(description, tags):
    """Use LLM to analyze if content may contain negative themes."""
    prompt = f"Analyze this media description and determine if it contains negative themes (arguments, violence, depression, dark religious themes): Description: {description}, Tags: {tags}. Answer only 'safe' or 'unsafe'."
    
    # Use your existing ChatOpenAI implementation
    response = await chat_model.apredict(prompt)
    return response.strip().lower() == "safe"
```

### Option 3: Computer Vision Filtering (Advanced)

For the most thorough approach, use your Quadro P1000 to run lightweight vision models:

```python
from transformers import AutoProcessor, AutoModelForImageClassification
import torch

# Load once at startup and keep in memory
processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained("Falconsai/nsfw_image_detection")
model = AutoModelForImageClassification.from_pretrained("Falconsai/nsfw_image_detection")

async def analyze_image_content(image_url):
    """Use vision model to detect problematic content."""
    # Download image
    image = Image.open(requests.get(image_url, stream=True).raw)
    
    # Process image
    inputs = processor(images=image, return_tensors="pt")
    with torch.no_grad():
        outputs = model(**inputs)
    
    # Get prediction
    predictions = outputs.logits.softmax(-1)
    return predictions[0, 0].item() > 0.8  # Safe threshold
```

## Implementation Recommendation

For immediate implementation, I recommend a combined approach:

1. Start with the keyword-based filtering (Option 1) - implement right away
2. Add the LLM-based analysis as a second step (Option 2) - within a week
3. Consider the computer vision approach (Option 3) for particularly sensitive use cases - longer term

This provides a graduated approach to content filtering that can be refined over time.

Would you like me to implement the keyword-based filter in your `pexel.py` file as a starting point?

# Integrating Pexels Images into Video Generation

## Current Implementation vs. New Feature

Your current system has:
1. **Pexels videos**: Used in ReelsMaker via `search_for_stock_videos()` in `pexel.py`
2. **AI-generated images**: Used in StoryTeller to create slide-based videos

## Required Work to Add Pexels Images

### 1. API Integration (Minimal Work)
```python
async def search_for_stock_images(
    limit: int = 5,
    query: str = "nature",
    orientation: str = None) -> list[str]:
    """Search for stock images on Pexels with orientation filtering."""
    # Implementation very similar to search_for_stock_videos
    # Different endpoint: "https://api.pexels.com/v1/search"
    # Different response structure to parse
```

### 2. Video Generation Pipeline (Moderate Work)
- Modify `VideoGenerator` to handle image sequences
- Reuse the core functionality from `StoryTeller` that turns images into video clips
- Add transition effects between static images

### 3. Configuration (Minimal Work)
```python
class ReelsMakerConfig(BaseGeneratorConfig):
    max_videos: int = 3
    media_source: Literal["pexels_videos", "pexels_images", "ai_images"] = "pexels_videos"
```

### 4. UI Updates (Moderate Work)
- Add option in Streamlit UI to select image vs. video source
- Create preview thumbnails for selected images

## Estimated Effort

**Total work required**: 2-3 days of development

1. **Day 1**: Implement Pexels image API integration and basic image-to-video conversion
2. **Day 2**: Add transitions and effects to make image sequences visually appealing
3. **Day 3**: Update UI and test the pipeline end-to-end

The good news is that most of the heavy lifting is already done in your codebase. The `StoryTeller` class has the core functionality for converting static images to video clips, and the Pexels API integration is straightforward to extend.

Would you like me to draft the implementation for the `search_for_stock_images()` function as a starting point?

# ReelsMaker UI Review - Ready to Build

I've reviewed the UI code thoroughly and your changes look good. The font selection and button logic have been properly implemented. Here are a few minor observations that don't block your build but could be considered for future improvements:

## Issues Fixed ✅

1. **Font selection** now correctly uses valid fonts from subtitle_gen.py
2. **Duplicate threads control** has been removed
3. **Generate button logic** simplified to one clear action
4. **Parameter naming** is consistent with `font_name`

## Minor Future Improvements

1. **Cancel button logic** - The cancel button appears after generation starts, but its state check happens in the same render cycle. It may need a secondary click to register.

2. **Timer display** - The elapsed time display uses a basic technique that requires page refreshes. A JavaScript component would provide smoother updates.

3. **Tab naming** - Consider renaming "Text to Speech" and "Text to Speech 2" to something more descriptive like "Direct Quote" and "AI-Generated Quote".

4. **Code cleanup** - Several commented code blocks could be removed for better readability.

## Ready to Build

The application is in a good state to build. The Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml files are properly configured to support the application's requirements, and the UI changes are compatible with the backend logic.

# Code Review: Voice Loading Implementation

I've reviewed the voice loading implementation, and it's now optimized to properly use the JSON files as the master source for voices. Here's an analysis of the key aspects:

## ✅ JSON Files as Primary Source

The code now properly uses:
- elevenlabs_voices.json for ElevenLabs voices
- tiktok_voices.json for TikTok voices
- Kokoro API service for Kokoro voices (as these appear to be dynamically provided)

## ✅ Session State Management

- Voices are loaded only once at startup and stored in session state
- This improves performance by avoiding repeated loading
- Key variables: `st.session_state["elevenlabs_voices"]`, `st.session_state["tiktok_voices"]`, etc.

## ✅ Proper Error Handling

- The code includes appropriate error handling if files can't be found
- Fallbacks only trigger if the JSON files are missing or corrupted
- All errors are properly logged

## ✅ UI Integration

- Dropdown menus now pull values from session state, not hardcoded lists
- This means any changes to your JSON files will be automatically reflected in the UI
- No unnecessary hard-coded values in the actual UI controls

## Maintenance Benefits

With this implementation, you can:
1. Add/remove voices just by editing the JSON files
2. Update voices across the application with a single file change
3. Avoid code modifications when only voice options need to change

The code is now optimized for maintainability while keeping the fallback mechanism for robustness.


# Ready to Build

Perfect timing! Your code is now in a great state for building. You've successfully implemented all the key changes:

✅ **Font selection** properly uses valid fonts available in your Docker container  
✅ **Voice providers** now load from JSON files rather than hardcoded values  
✅ **Language selection** stays visible but disables appropriately  
✅ **Previous state clearing** implemented to fix the text persistence issue  
✅ **Threads control** correctly configured with appropriate step sizes  
✅ **Button logic** simplified for better UX  
✅ **Color picker controls** properly aligned  

The application should build cleanly and function as expected. After building, we can revisit the StoryTeller integration to add image-based content generation as a future enhancement.


# Docker Configuration Looks Good for Build

Your docker-compose file is now properly configured to use the Intel UHD GPU through VA-API hardware acceleration. Here's what's correctly set up:

## ✅ Intel GPU Configuration
- `/dev/dri:/dev/dri` volume mount provides access to the Intel GPU device
- `LIBVA_DRIVER_NAME=iHD` correctly specifies the driver for newer Intel UHD Graphics
- `FFMPEG_HWACCEL=vaapi` enables hardware acceleration in FFmpeg
- `FFMPEG_VAAPI_DEVICE=/dev/dri/renderD128` points to the correct device

## ✅ Runtime Configuration
- `runtime: "runc"` ensures proper device passthrough for GPU access

## ✅ CPU Optimizations
- Thread settings provide fallback for operations that can't use the GPU

## How This Enables GPU Acceleration

When your container starts, FFmpeg will:
1. Detect the VA-API device at the specified location
2. Use hardware-accelerated encoding/decoding when possible
3. Log hardware acceleration activity to your ffmpeg_report.log

Your container should now leverage the Intel UHD GPU for significantly faster video transcoding operations. The CPU optimizations will handle any operations that can't be offloaded to the GPU.

This configuration is ready to build and should work properly.


# Great! Cancel Button is Working

Excellent news that the cancel button is now functioning correctly! This is a significant improvement to the user experience.

Looking at your code implementation, you have:

✅ **Multiple cancellation check points** strategically placed in the workflow
✅ **Proper cleanup** of temporary files when cancelled
✅ **Clear logging** of cancellation events
✅ **Redundancy in checks** to ensure cancellation is detected reliably

## How It Works

1. User clicks "Cancel Generation" button
2. `cancel_requested` flag is set in session state
3. The backend checks for this flag at multiple points during processing
4. When detected, processing stops and resources are cleaned up
5. The UI updates to show cancellation status

This implementation strikes a good balance between responsiveness and resource management, allowing users to stop lengthy video generations when needed.

~~Would you like to add any other improvements to the cancel functionality, or should we focus on other aspects of the application now?~~

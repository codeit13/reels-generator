# My Copilot Preferences

## Code Recommendations
- DO NOT CHANGE any existing code or comments that are not in the scope of the focused task.
- Use clear headings indicating which file to modify
- Always start code blocks with the filepath comment
- Show file navigation instructions when multiple files need changes
- Do not make assumptions.  If you need me to add more code to context, call it out.

## Format Preferences
- Use PEP 8 style for Python
- Include descriptive comments for complex logic
- Keep line lengths under 88 characters
